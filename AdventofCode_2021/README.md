# ADVENT 2021

In this directory i have been doing the advent of code 2021. This is a challenge-a-day advent calendar where you receive a christmas-themed coding challenge every morning. I used this year's to try to improve my python skills by using some of its especial features.
I dont try to create the most eficient, or understandable code. Even tho i upload the first eight challenges, i may change some of the them because im not satisfied with the result.
